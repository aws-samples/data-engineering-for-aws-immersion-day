## Let's Begin!

### AutoComplete DMS lab:

Download the [lab instruction file](/2a-Lab-AutoComplete-DMS.pdf)

This lab is designed to automate the Data Lake hydration with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), so we can fast forward to [Lab2-Transforming in the data lake with Glue](#lab-2---Transforming-data-with-Glue).

If you prefer to get hands-on with AWS DMS service, please skip this lab and proceed to [Workshop Setup](#workshop-setup) and [Lab1-Hydrateing the data lake via DMS](#Lab-1---Hydrating-the-data-lake-via-DMS)

[*^ back to the top*](#Requirements)

### Workshop Setup:

1. Open the CloudFormation launch template link in a new tab. It will load a CloudFormation Dashboard and start the creation process for your lab environment, which deploys:
 <pre>
    - A required Virtual Private Cloud for the DMS
    - An Amazon S3 bucket for the Data Lake
    - A required S3 bucket policy to restrict the data access by AWS DMS service
    - A Glue Service Role to use in later hands-on lab
 </pre>

   
Click the **Deploy to AWS** icons below to stand up the core workshop infrastructure. 

| Region | Launch Template |
| ------------ | ------------- | 
**N.Virginia** (us-east-1) | [![Launch CloudFormation](/ee_helper/assets/images/00-deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=dmslab-student&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/ws-assets-prod-iad-r-iad-ed304a55c2ca1aee/976050cc-0606-4b23-b49f-ca7b8ac4b153/v1/DMSlab_student_CFN.yaml)  


2. The template will automatically take you to the CloudFormation Console and start the stack creation process in **N.Virginia** region.

Proceed through the wizard to launch the stack. Leave all options at their default values, but make sure to check the box to allow CloudFormation to create IAM roles on your behalf:

![IAM resources acknowledgement](/ee_helper/assets/images/00-cf-create.png)

See the *Events* tab for progress on the stack launch that may take up to 5 minutes. You can also see details of any problems here if the launch fails. Proceed to the next step once the stack status advances to "CREATE_COMPLETE".

3. Click in the Output tab and take note of value for BucketName, GlueLabRole and DMSLabRoleS3, which you are going to use in future labs.

## Lab 6 - Modernize Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift Spectrum

In this lab, we show you how to query petabytes of data with Amazon Redshift and exabytes of data in your Amazon S3 data lake, without loading or moving objects. We will also demonstrate how you can leverage views which union data in direct attached storage as well as in your S3 Datalake to create a single source of truth.  Finally, we will demonstrate strategies for aging off old data into S3 and maintaining only the most recent data in Amazon Redshift direct attached storage.

## Before You Begin

This lab requires a new Redshift cluster in **US-WEST-2 (Oregon)**, use the following link to <br>
[![Launch](/ee_helper/assets/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?stackName=redshift-lab&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/ws-assets-prod-iad-r-iad-ed304a55c2ca1aee/976050cc-0606-4b23-b49f-ca7b8ac4b153/v1/Redshift_PreLab_CFN.yaml&param_DatabaseName=dev&param_ClusterType=multi-node&param_NumberOfNodes=2&param_NodeType=ds2.8xlarge&param_MasterUsername=awsuser&param_MasterUserPassword=Awsuser123&param_InboundTraffic=0.0.0.0/0&param_PortNumber=5439)

And gather the following information from the stack output above:
* [Your-Redshift_Hostname]
* [Your-Redshift_Port]
* [Your-Redshift_Username]
* [Your-Redshift_Password]
* [Your-Redshift_Role_ARN]
![](/ee_helper/assets/images/cf_output_rs.png)

## What Happened in 2016
In the first part of this lab, we will perform the following activities:
* Load the Green company data for January 2016 into Redshift direct-attached storage (DAS) with COPY.
* Collect supporting/refuting evidence for the impact of the January, 2016 blizzard on taxi usage.
* The CSV data is by month on Amazon S3. Here's a quick screenshot from the S3 console:

````
![](/ee_helper/assets/images/green_preview.png)
	
	
### Build your DDL 
Login to your query editor, create a schema `workshop_das` and table `workshop_das.green_201601_csv` for tables that will reside on the Redshift compute nodes, AKA the Redshift direct-attached storage (DAS) tables.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>
	
```python
CREATE SCHEMA workshop_das;

CREATE TABLE workshop_das.green_201601_csv 
(
  vendorid                VARCHAR(4),
  pickup_datetime         TIMESTAMP,
  dropoff_datetime        TIMESTAMP,
  store_and_fwd_flag      VARCHAR(1),
  ratecode                INT,
  pickup_longitude        FLOAT4,
  pickup_latitude         FLOAT4,
  dropoff_longitude       FLOAT4,
  dropoff_latitude        FLOAT4,
  passenger_count         INT,
  trip_distance           FLOAT4,
  fare_amount             FLOAT4,
  extra                   FLOAT4,
  mta_tax                 FLOAT4,
  tip_amount              FLOAT4,
  tolls_amount            FLOAT4,
  ehail_fee               FLOAT4,
  improvement_surcharge   FLOAT4,
  total_amount            FLOAT4,
  payment_type            VARCHAR(4),
  trip_type               VARCHAR(4)
)
DISTSTYLE EVEN 
SORTKEY (passenger_count,pickup_datetime);
```

</p>
</details>

### Build your Copy Command 
* Build your copy command via Redshift query editor, to copy the data from Amazon S3. This dataset has the number of taxi rides in the month of January 2016. 

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
COPY workshop_das.green_201601_csv
FROM 's3://us-west-2.serverless-analytics/NYC-Pub/green/green_tripdata_2016-01.csv'
IAM_ROLE '[Your-Redshift_Role_ARN]'
DATEFORMAT 'auto'
IGNOREHEADER 1
DELIMITER ','
IGNOREBLANKLINES
;
```
</p>
</details>

* Determine how many rows you just loaded.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>
	
```
select count(1) from workshop_das.green_201601_csv;
--1445285
```

</p>
</details>

**HINT: The `[Your-Redshift_Role_ARN]` in the above command should be replaced by the CloudFormation output value at the beginning of the lab.**

### Pin-point the Blizzard 
In this month, there is a date which had the lowest number of taxi rides due to a blizzard. Can you find that date?

<details><summary>SQL-Based Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
SELECT TO_CHAR(pickup_datetime, 'YYYY-MM-DD'),
COUNT(*)
FROM workshop_das.green_201601_csv
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

</p>
</details>


## Go Back in Time
In the next part of this lab, we will perform the following activities:
* Query historical data residing on S3 by create an external DB for Redshift Spectrum.
* Introspect the historical data, perhaps rolling-up the data in novel ways to see trends over time, or other dimensions.
* Enforce reasonable use of the cluster with Redshift Spectrum-specific Query Monitoring Rules (QMR).
	* Test the QMR setup by writing an excessive-use query.

**Note the partitioning scheme is Year, Month, Type (where Type is a taxi company). Here's a quick Screenshot:**

````
![](/ee_helper/assets/images/canonical_type.png)


### Create external schema (and DB) for Redshift Spectrum
Because external tables are stored in a shared Glue Catalog for use within the AWS ecosystem, they can be built and maintained using a few different tools, e.g. Athena, Redshift, and Glue. 
	
* Use the AWS Glue Crawler to create your external table adb305.ny_pub stored in parquet format under location s3://us-west-2.serverless-analytics/canonical/NY-Pub/.

	1. Navigate to the **Glue Crawler Page**. https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?#catalog:tab=crawlers
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_0.png)
	1. Click on *Add Crawler*, and enter the crawler name *NYTaxiCrawler* and click *Next*.
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_1.png)
	1. Select *Data stores* as the source type and click *Next*.
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_2.png)
	1. Choose *S3* as the data store and the include path of *s3://us-west-2.serverless-analytics/canonical/NY-Pub*
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_3.png)
	1. *Create an IAM Role* and enter the name AWSGlueServiceRole-*RedshiftImmersion*.  
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_4.png)
	1. Select *Run on demand* for the frequency.
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_5.png)
	1. Click on *Add database* and enter the Database of *spectrumdb*
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_6.png)
	1. Select all remaining defaults. Once the Crawler has been created, click on *Run Crawler*.
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_7.png)
	1. Once the Crawler has completed its run, you will see a new table in the Glue Catalog. https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?#catalog:tab=tables
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_8.png)
	1. Click on the *ny_pub* table, notice the recordCount of 2.87 billion. 
	![](/ee_helper/assets/images/crawler_9.png)


* Now that the table has been cataloged, switch back to your Redshift query editor and create an external schema **adb305** pointing to your Glue Catalog Database **spectrumdb**

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
CREATE external SCHEMA adb305
FROM data catalog DATABASE 'spectrumdb' 
IAM_ROLE '[Your-Redshift_Role_ARN]'
CREATE external DATABASE if not exists;
```

</p>
</details>


* Run the query from the previous step using the external table instead of the direct-attached storage (DAS).

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
SELECT TO_CHAR(pickup_datetime, 'YYYY-MM-DD'),
COUNT(*)
FROM adb305.ny_pub
WHERE YEAR = 2016 and Month = 01
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

</p>
</details>
  
### Add a Redshift Spectrum Query Monitoring Rule to ensure reasonable use
In Amazon Redshift workload management (WLM), query monitoring rules define metrics-based performance boundaries for WLM queues and specify what action to take when a query goes beyond those boundaries. Setup a Query Monitoring Rule to ensure reasonable use.

```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.html
```
Take a look at SVL_QUERY_METRICS_SUMMARY view shows the maximum values of metrics for completed queries. This view is derived from the STL_QUERY_METRICS system table. Use the values in this view as an aid to determine threshold values for defining query monitoring rules.

```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVL_QUERY_METRICS_SUMMARY.html
```

Quick Note on QLM: The WLM configuration properties are either dynamic or static. Dynamic properties can be applied to the database without a cluster reboot, but static properties require a cluster reboot for changes to take effect. Additional info here:

```
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/workload-mgmt-config.html
```

## Create a Single Version of Truth
In the next part of this lab, we will demonstrate how to create a view which has data that is consolidated from S3 via Spectrum and the Redshift direct-attached storage.

### Create a view 
Create a view that covers both the January, 2016 Green company DAS table with the historical data residing on S3 to make a single table exclusively for the Green data scientists. Use CTAS to create a table with data from January, 2016 for the Green company. Compare the runtime to populate this with the COPY runtime earlier.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
CREATE TABLE workshop_das.taxi_201601 AS 
SELECT * FROM adb305.ny_pub 
WHERE year = 2016 AND month = 1 AND type = 'green';
```

</p>
</details>

Note: What about column compression/encoding? Remember that on a CTAS, Amazon Redshift automatically assigns compression encoding as follows:

* Columns that are defined as sort keys are assigned RAW compression.
* Columns that are defined as BOOLEAN, REAL, or DOUBLE PRECISION data types are assigned RAW compression.
* All other columns are assigned LZO compression.

````
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CTAS_usage_notes.html 

````

```
ANALYZE COMPRESSION workshop_das.taxi_201601
```

Here's the output in case you want to use it:

|Column|Encoding|Est_reduction_pct|
|---|---|---|
|vendorid|zstd|79.46|
|pickup_datetime|zstd|33.91|
|dropoff_datetime|zstd|34.08|
|ratecode|zstd|61.75|
|passenger_count|zstd|61.23|
|trip_distance|zstd|73.34|
|fare_amount|bytedict|85.61|
|total_amount|zstd|75.28|
|payment_type|zstd|68.76|
|year|zstd|91.13|
|month|zstd|91.13|
|type|zstd|89.23|


### Complete populating the table 
Add to the January, 2016 table with an INSERT/SELECT statement for the other taxi companies.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
INSERT INTO workshop_das.taxi_201601 (
  SELECT * 
  FROM adb305.ny_pub 
  WHERE year = 2016 AND month = 1 AND type != 'green');
```

</p>
</details>

### Remove overlaps in the Spectrum table 
Now that we've loaded all January, 2016 data, we can remove the partitions from the Spectrum table so there is no overlap between the direct-attached storage (DAS) table and the Spectrum table.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
ALTER TABLE adb305.ny_pub DROP PARTITION(year=2016, month=1, type='fhv'); 
ALTER TABLE adb305.ny_pub DROP PARTITION(year=2016, month=1, type='green'); 
ALTER TABLE adb305.ny_pub DROP PARTITION(year=2016, month=1, type='yellow'); 
```

</p>
</details>


### Create a view with no Schema Binding
Create a view **adb305_view_NYTaxiRides** from **workshop_das.taxi_201601** that allows seamless querying of the DAS and Spectrum data.

<details><summary>Hint</summary>
<p>

```python
CREATE VIEW adb305_view_NYTaxiRides AS
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201601
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM adb305.ny_pub
WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING;

```

</p>
</details>

### Is it Surprising this is valid SQL?

* Note the use of the partition columns in the SELECT and WHERE clauses. Where were those columns in your Spectrum table definition?
* Note the filters being applied either at the partition or file levels in the Spectrum portion of the query (versus the Redshift DAS section).
* If you actually run the query (and not just generate the explain plan), does the runtime surprise you? Why or why not?

````
EXPLAIN 
SELECT year, month, type, COUNT(*) 
FROM adb305_view_NYTaxiRides 
WHERE year = 2016 AND month IN (1) AND passenger_count = 4

## Plan for the Future
In this final part of this lab, we will compare different strategies for maintaining more recent or *HOT* data within Redshift direct-attached storage, and keeping older *COLD* data in S3 by performing the following steps:
* Allow for trailing 5 quarters reporting by adding the Q4 2015 data to Redshift DAS:
	* Anticipating that we’ll want to ”age-off” the oldest quarter on a 3 month basis, architect your DAS table to make this easy to maintain and query.
	* Adjust your Redshift Spectrum table to exclude the Q4 2015 data.
* Develop and execute a plan to move the Q4 2015 data to S3.
	* What are the discrete steps to be performed?
	* What extra-Redshift functionality must be leveraged?
	* Simulating the extra-Redshift steps with the existing Parquet data, age-off the Q4 2015 data from Redshift DAS 	and perform any needed steps to maintain a single version of the truth.

* There are several options to accomplish this goal. Anticipating that we’ll want to ”age-off” the oldest quarter on a 3 month basis, architect your DAS table to make this easy to maintain and query. How about something like this?

````
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW adb305_view_NYTaxiRides AS
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201504 
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201601
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201602
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201603
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_201604
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM adb305.ny_pub
WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING;
````
	
* Or something like this? Bulk DELETE-s in Redshift are actually quite fast (with one-time single-digit minute time to VACUUM), so this is also a valid configuration as well:

````	
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW adb305_view_NYTaxiRides AS
   SELECT * FROM workshop_das.taxi_current
UNION ALL 
  SELECT * FROM adb305.ny_pub
WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING;
````

* If needed, the Redshift DAS tables can also be populated from the Parquet data with COPY. Note: This will highlight a data design when we created the Parquet data

**COPY with Parquet doesn’t currently include a way to specify the partition columns as sources to populate the target Redshift DAS table. The current expectation is that since there’s no overhead (performance-wise) and little cost in also storing the partition data as actual columns on S3, customers will store the partition column data as well.**

* We’re going to show how to work with the scenario where this pattern wasn’t followed. Use the single table option for this example
	
````
CREATE TABLE workshop_das.taxi_current 
DISTSTYLE EVEN 
SORTKEY(year, month, type) AS 
SELECT * FROM adb305.ny_pub WHERE 1 = 0;
````

* And, create a helper table that doesn't include the partition columns from the Redshift Spectrum table.

````
CREATE TABLE workshop_das.taxi_loader AS 
  SELECT vendorid, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, ratecode, passenger_count, 
  	trip_distance, fare_amount, total_amount, payment_type 
  FROM workshop_das.taxi_current 
  WHERE 1 = 0;
````

### Parquet copy continued

* The population could be scripted easily; there are also a few different patterns that could be followed.  Below is a script which issues a seperate copy command for each partition where the **type=green**.  Once complete, seperate scripts would need to be used for other **type** partitions.

* Now, regardless of method, there’s a view covering the trailing 5 quarters in Redshift DAS, and all of time on Redshift Spectrum, completely transparent to users of the view. What would be the steps to “age-off” the Q4 2015 data?

	1. Put a copy of the data from Redshift DAS table to S3. What would be the command(s)?
		* UNLOAD
	1. Extend the Redshift Spectrum table to cover the Q4 2015 data with Redshift Spectrum.
		* ADD Partition.
	1. Remove the data from the Redshift DAS table:
		* Either DELETE or DROP TABLE (depending on the implementation).

## Workshop Cleanup

This is really important because if you leave stuff running in your account, it will continue to generate charges.  Make sure you clean them up by deleting the CloudFormation stack launched at the beginning of the workshop.
